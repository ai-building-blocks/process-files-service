## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created initial FastAPI application structure
- ✅ Implemented basic file monitoring and processing
- ✅ Added SQLite persistence layer
- ✅ Created project structure with UV package manager
- ✅ Set up Docker containerization

### Phase 2: S3 Configuration - COMPLETED
- ✅ Added configurable SSL verification for S3/MinIO
- ✅ Implemented configurable prefix paths
- ✅ Added prefix validation
- ✅ Improved S3 client configuration
- ✅ Added proper error handling for S3 operations
- ✅ Implemented retry mechanisms

### Phase 3: API Enhancement (In Progress)
- ✅ Enhanced file processing endpoint with ID/filename support
- ✅ Added ProcessFileRequest validation model
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Updated API documentation

**Key Decisions**:
- Selected FastAPI for its async capabilities and automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Chose SQLite for initial persistence layer due to simplicity
- Implemented background processing for file monitoring
- Using UV as package manager with pyproject.toml for better dependency resolution and performance
- Implemented ULID-based file naming for uniqueness and sorting capabilities
- Chose pyproject.toml over requirements.txt for modern Python packaging

**Technical Debt**:
- Need to add proper error handling for S3 operations
- File processing could be more robust
- Progress tracking needs implementation
- Need to implement proper cleanup routines

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (2024-12-17 - In Progress)
- ✅ Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- ✅ Docker Compose setup for API and worker services
- ✅ Basic S3/MinIO integration with boto3
- ⏳ Implementing proper error handling
- ⏳ Adding monitoring and logging
- ⏳ Setting up proper health checks

**Planned Decisions**:
- Evaluating MinIO vs S3 configuration options
- Considering migration to PostgreSQL for better scalability
- Exploring structured logging implementation

## Design Decisions

### Architecture

#### API Design
**Decision**: REST API with async processing  
**Rationale**: 
- Long-running file processing jobs require async processing
- REST provides familiar interface for clients
- AsyncIO in FastAPI enables efficient handling of multiple requests
- ULID-based file naming enables natural temporal ordering

#### Storage Strategy
**Current**: S3/MinIO + SQLite  
**Planned**: S3/MinIO + PostgreSQL  
**Rationale**:
- Started with SQLite for simplicity
- S3/MinIO provides scalable object storage
- PostgreSQL will enable better querying and concurrent access
- Keeping processed files in both S3 and local storage for redundancy

#### Security
**Implemented**:
- Basic input validation
- Environment-based configuration
- File tracking with metadata

**Planned**:
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Enhanced input sanitization
- Proper credential rotation

## Technical Specifications

### Current Implementation
```yaml
Language: Python 3.8+
Framework: FastAPI
Storage: S3/MinIO + SQLite
Processing: Background tasks
State: SQLite database
Package Manager: UV
```

### Planned Enhancements
```yaml
Storage: S3/MinIO + PostgreSQL
Authentication: API Keys
Monitoring: Structured Logging
Docker: Multi-stage build with UV package manager
Container: API and worker services with health checks
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: File Tracking
**Problem**: Maintaining consistency between S3 and local storage  
**Current Solution**: SQLite database with versioning  
**Planned Improvement**: More sophisticated tracking with proper cleanup

### Challenge 2: Error Handling
**Problem**: Robust error handling for external services  
**Current Solution**: Basic error catching  
**Planned Solution**: Proper retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
